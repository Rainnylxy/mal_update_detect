# 💀 Ransomware Behavior Simulator (Safe for Testing)

This Python script simulates the behavior of a basic ransomware attack — without causing real harm.  
It mimics file encryption, ransom note drops, dummy process creation, network callbacks, and persistence tactics to help analysts test detection systems in a controlled environment.

---

## 🚨 What This Script Does

- 📄 Creates fake ransom notes in key directories
- 🔐 Simulates encryption by renaming `.txt`, `.doc`, `.pdf`, `.jpg` files (adds `.locked` extension only)
- 🧠 Spawns dummy "malicious" processes
- 🌐 Simulates command & control (C2) network connection
- 🗂️ Mimics persistence by writing to the desktop
- 🧾 Logs all activity to `simulator_log.txt`

## ⚠️ Safety Notice

✅ **This simulation is completely safe.**  
It **does not encrypt** any content, run real malicious code, or alter system-critical files.

> ⚠️ Only run in a safe test environment (like a VM or lab machine).  
> Do **not** use in production or on sensitive systems.
