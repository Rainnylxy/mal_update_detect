"""
This is an example attack with the malware implemented

Best practice for an attack like this is to check if the python code is compiled before executing (in the payload)
that way developers won't notice anything on their machines until the users (often tech illiterate) gets it.
You can check like this:
    if getattr(_sys, "frozen", False) and (hasattr(_sys, "_MEIPASS") or _sys.executable.endswith(".exe")):
        print(1)

Any actual malware would also use something more advanced to obfuscate strings than caesar ciphers. ChatGPT can easily
see that exec is used which is bad, but it doesn't think it's malware, if the hacker checked for
a compiled env before attacking, so malware vms won't report it if it's not compiled. (you can test it out with chatgpt)
